# RADEXF
RADEXF is a highly flexible, user friendly program to compute the various exchange factors (view factors, direct exchange areas and total exchange areas) required to carry out radiative heat transfer analyses using the zone method. RADEXF is designed to be able to perform calculations not only in idealised enclosures but also in realistic three-dimensional geometries. The atmosphere within the enclosure may itself absorb and emit thermal radiation, thereby participating in the radiative heat exchange. RADEXF allows for this by calculating not just surface to surface exchange factors but also gas to gas, gas to surface and surface to surface exchange factors.
